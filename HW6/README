	i. The new probability of day 1 is hot is 0.491 (the old probability is 0.871).

		p(133 | HHH) = p(1 | H) * p(3 | H) * p(3 | H) = 0.1 * 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.049

		p(133 | CHH) = p(1 | C) * p(3 | H) * p(3 | H) = 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.343

	The probability CHH as explanations of the first three days of data is higher, that's why the probability of first day being hot goes down.


	ii.	The probability that day 2 is hot changes from 0.977 to 0.918.
		Cell K28.

	iii. The graph of p(H) and p(H -> H) on day 1 fell greatly (from approximately 0.9 to 0), while the plot of p(H -> C) and p(C -> C) on day 1 raised slightly. Other part of the graph almost remains unchanged.

	p(H) on day 1 changed from 1.0 to 0. p(H) on day 2 changed from 0.995 to 0.557.

	(b)
	i. p(H) immediately falls to 0 when only 1 ice cream is eaten during the day.

	ii. The graph looks exactly the same as the one before reestimation.

	iii. p(1 | H) = 0.
	The probability p(1 | H) after 10 iterations is defined by sum_{d=1^33}( p_d(H, 1) ) / sum_{d=1^33} ( p_d(H) ).
	
	Each p_d(H, 1) is equal to p_d(H) if only 1 ice cream is consumed at that day and equal to 0 otherwise.
	
	p_d(H) = (alpha_d(H) * beta_d(H) / ( alpha_d(H) * beta_d(H) + alpha_d(C) * beta_d(C) )
	
	alpha_d(H) = ( alpha_{d-1}(C) * p(H | C) + alpha_{d-1}(H) * p(H | H) ) * p(1 | H) if 1 ice cream is cunsumed at day d.
	
	p(1 | H) at 10th iteration refers to sum_{d=1^33}( p_d(H, 1) ) / sum_{d=1^33} ( p_d(H) ) of 9th iteration, 
	and p(1 | H) at 9th iteration refers to sum_{d=1^33}( p_d(H, 1) ) / sum_{d=1^33} ( p_d(H) ) of 8th iteration, and so on.

	Since we changed p(1 | H) from 0.1 to 0 at the beginning, all alpha_d(H) that relates to eating 1 ice cream at day d in each iteration will be 0. Therefore, p_d(H, 1) will also be 0.
	
	Thus, p(1 | H) = sum_{d=1^33}( p_d(H, 1) ) / sum_{d=1^33} ( p_d(H) ) = 0 after 10 iterations.
