	(a)
	i. The new probability of day 1 is hot is 0.491 (the old probability is 0.871).

		p(133 | HHH) = p(1 | H) * p(3 | H) * p(3 | H) = 0.1 * 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.049

		p(133 | CHH) = p(1 | C) * p(3 | H) * p(3 | H) = 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.343

	The probability CHH as explanations of the first three days of data is higher, that's why the probability of first day being hot goes down.


	ii.	The probability that day 2 is hot changes from 0.977 to 0.918.
		Cell K28.

	iii. The graph of p(H) and p(H -> H) on day 1 fell greatly (from approximately 0.9 to 0), while the plot of p(H -> C) and p(C -> C) on day 1 raised slightly. Other part of the graph almost remains unchanged.

	p(H) on day 1 changed from 1.0 to 0. p(H) on day 2 changed from 0.995 to 0.557.

	(b)
	i. p(H) immediately falls to 0 when 1 ice cream is eaten during the day.

	ii. The graph looks exactly the same as the one before reestimation.

	iii. p(1 | H) = 0.
	Since we changed p(1 | H) from 0.1 to 0, the values of entire column of p(->H, 1) turn to 0, making the new value of p(1 | H) in the next iteration 0 and so on. 

	(c) The first word's beta probability.
